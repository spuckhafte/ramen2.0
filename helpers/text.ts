Building and maintaining the bot takes a lot of effort and surely is hectic. 
With Ramen Plus, you have the opportunity to directly contribute to its growth and ensure that it remains a reliable and efficient tool for all your NB needs.
Btw its a two way deal: You also get **special perks** for your server with Ramen Plus.

All the donators will be mentioned in the \`r plus subs\` list.

__**SPECIAL PERKS ðŸ’ª**__

**Server Specific LBs**
With this feature, you can have personalized leaderboards that track users' progress only within your server. These leaderboards can be reset at any time using a specific command. You also have the ability to control who has the permission to reset the leaderboards.
These server-specific leaderboards are particularly useful if you plan to host any NB events within your server.

**Pricing:** 
\`USD-2 / INR-150 per month\` 
\`USD-20 / INR-1500 per year\`

__**PAYMENT OPTIONS**__

\`2.\` **UPI: _${Bio.UPI}_**
*If you prefer to pay by any other means, please DM me (spuckhafte)*

If you wish to **donate without any perks**, please DM me, as I'll need to include your name in the **"r plus subs"** list.

__**AFTERMATH**__

Once the payment is done, open a ticket in [Official Ramen Server](${Bio.OFFICIAL_SERVER}) (or DM me) and send the screen-shot or any type of proof of payment.
