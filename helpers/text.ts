Running any NB command will register a reminder for your cooldown and the bot will ping you on time.
### When to use \`n cd\`?
- If you do a task in a *ramen-less* server, __n cd__ will be required in a *ramen-full* server.
- To register a reminder for **vote**.
- If the bot restarts due to an error, it will attempt to retrieve all the reminders for every user. However, this process may take some time (5-10 mins). If you happen to be online during this period, you can also use __n cd__ to immediately register the *lost rems*.
